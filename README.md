# GFlat
GFlat was made as a final project for Principles of Programming Languages (CS334) at Williams College.

## About
GFlat is a programming language designed to make it easy to create chord-based musical backing tracks. This repository contains the language AST, a parser for the language built using the Parsecco library, and an interpreter which produces .xml file text. GFlat programs are executable through .NET, and more details about the language grammar, how to run the programs, and example programs and outputs are available in the /spec folder.
